2. A window will pop up displaying the map of India.
3. A prompt will appear, asking you to guess the name of an Indian state.
4. Type the name of the state you think is correct and press "Enter."

7. If you want to exit the game at any point, type "Exit" as your answer.

## Missing States

If you couldn't guess all the Indian states and choose to exit the game, a list of the missing states will be saved in a CSV file named "states_to_be_learn.csv." You can use this list to help you learn the names of the states you missed.
